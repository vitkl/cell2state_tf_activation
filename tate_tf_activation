DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       The APS value is calculated based on the current scheduling
       cycle, so jobs are not guaranteed to be dispatched in this order.

       Pending jobs are ordered by APS value. Jobs with system APS val‐
       ues are listed first, from highest to lowest APS value. Jobs with
       calculated APS values are listed next ordered from high to low
       value. Finally, jobs not in an APS queue are listed. Jobs with
       equal APS values are listed in order of submission time. APS val‐
       ues of jobs not in an APS queue are shown with a dash (-).

       If queues are configured with the same priority, bjobs -aps may
       not show jobs in the correct expected dispatch order. Jobs may be
       dispatched in the order the queues are configured in lsb.queues.
       You should avoid configuring queues with the same priority.

       For resizable jobs, -aps displays the latest APS information for
       running jobs with active resize allocation requests. LSF handles
       the dynamic priority for running jobs with active resize
       requests. The displayed job priority can change from time to
       time.

       When specified, bjobs displays any times (but not time stamps) in
       the customized output in _h_h_:_m_m_:_s_s format.

       The cpu_used field normally uses one decimal place in the bjobs
       output, but if you specify -hms, bjobs rounds up this field to
       the next second. For example, if the cpu_used field is 0.2 sec‐
       onds, specifying -hms rounds this number up to 00:00:01.

       For the runtimelimit field, if the AABBSS__RRUUNNLLIIMMIITT parameter is
       defined as Y in the lsb.params file and you specify -hms, bjobs
       does not display the host name. That is, if ABS_RUNLIMIT=Y is
       defined in the lsb.params file, bjobs normally displays the host
       name after the runtime limit (for example, 3.0/hostA). If you
       specify -hms, bjobs displays the runtime limit without the host
       name (for example, 00:03:00). This also applies if the AABBSS__RRUUNN‐‐
       LLIIMMIITT parameter is defined as Y in the lsb.applications file and
       you specify -hms to a job that is submitted to an application
       profile with ABS_RUNLIMIT=Y.

       Specifying the -hms option overrides the LLSSBB__HHMMSS__TTIIMMEE__FFOORRMMAATT
       environment variable, which overrides the LLSSBB__HHMMSS__TTIIMMEE__FFOORRMMAATT
       parameter setting in the lsf.conf file.

       This option applies only to output for the bjobs -o and bjobs -o
       -json commands for customized output. This option has no effect
       when run with bjobs without the -o option.

       returns jobA and jobarray[1], *AAA*[1] returns the first element
       in all job arrays with names containing AAA, however job1[*] will
       not return anything since the wildcard is within the array index.

       If the job was submitted with the bsub -K command, the -l option
       displays Synchronous Execution.

       Use the bjobs -A -l command to display detailed information for
       job arrays, including job array job limit (% _j_o_b___l_i_m_i_t) if set.

       Use the bjobs -ss -l command to display detailed information for
       session scheduler jobs.

       Use the bjobs -data -l command to display detailed information
       for jobs with data requirements (for example, jobs that are sub‐
       mitted with -data).

       The bjobs -pl command displays detailed information about all
       pending jobs of the invoker.

       If the JJOOBB__IIDDLLEE parameter is configured in the queue, use bjobs
       -l to display job idle exception information.

       If you submitted your job with the -U option to use advance
       reservations that are created with the brsvadd command, bjobs -l
       shows the reservation ID used by the job.

       If the LLSSFF__HHPPCC__EEXXTTEENNSSIIOONNSS==""SSHHOORRTT__PPIIDDLLIISSTT"" parameter is specified
       in the lsf.conf file, the output from bjobs is shortened to dis‐
       play only the first PID and a count of the process group IDs
       (PGIDs) and process IDs for the job. Without SSHHOORRTT__PPIIDDLLIISSTT, all
       of the process IDs (PIDs) for a job are displayed.

       If the LLSSFF__HHPPCC__EEXXTTEENNSSIIOONNSS==""HHOOSSTT__RRUUSSAAGGEE"" parameter is specified in
       the lsf.conf file, the output from the bjobs -l command reports
       the correct rusage-based usage and the total rusage that is being
       charged to the execution host.

       If you submitted a job with multiple resource requirement strings
       by using the bsub -R option for the order, same, rusage, and
       select sections, bjobs -l displays a single, merged resource
       requirement string for those sections, as if they were submitted
       by using a single -R option.

       If you submitted a job by using the OR (||) expression to specify
       alternative resources, this option displays the Execution rusage
       string with which the job runs.

       Predicted start time for PEND reserve job is not shown with the
       bjobs -l command option. LSF does not calculate the predicted
       start time for PEND reserve job if no back fill queue is config‐
       ured in the system. In that case, resource reservation for PEND
       jobs works as normal, and no predicted start time is calculated.

       For resizable jobs, the -l option displays active pending resize
       allocation requests, and the latest job priority for running jobs
       with active pending resize requests.

       For jobs with user-based fairshare scheduling, displays the
       charging SAAP (share attribute account path).

       For jobs submitted to an absolute priority scheduling (APS)
       queue, -l shows the ADMIN factor value and the system APS value
       if they are not set by the administrator for the job.

       For jobs submitted with SSH X11 forwarding, displays that the job
       was submitted in SSH X11 forwarding mode as well as the SSH com‐
       mand submitted (set in LLSSBB__SSSSHH__XXFFOORRWWAARRDD__CCMMDD in lsf.conf).

       If the job was auto-attached to a guarantee SLA, -l displays the
       auto-attached SLA name.

       Specified CWD shows the value of the bsub -cwd option or the
       value of LLSSBB__JJOOBB__CCWWDD. The CWD path with pattern values is dis‐
       played. CWD is the submission directory where bsub ran. If speci‐
       fied CWD was not defined, this field is not shown. The execution
       CWD with pattern values is always shown.

       If the job was submitted with an energy policy, to automatically
       select a CPU frequency, -l shows the Combined CPU frequency (the
       CPU frequency that is selected for the job based on the energy
       policy tag, energy policy, and threshold file). If the job was
       submitted with a user-defined CPU frequency (by using bsub
       -freq), -l shows the Specified CPU frequency for the job.

       For jobs submitted with the default GPU requirements (with the
       option -gpu -), use the bjobs -l command to see the default job-
       level resource requirement without details like <num=1...>:
       Requested GPU.

       If the -gpu option specifies GPU requirements (for example, -gpu
       num=3, the bjobs -l shows the details as Requested GPU <num=3>.

       The bjobs -l command displays an output section for GPU jobs that
       shows the combined and effective GPU requirements that are speci‐
       fied for the job. The GPU requirement string is in the format of
       the GGPPUU__RREEQQ parameter in the application profile or queue:

       *  The combined GPU requirement is merged based on the current
          GPU requirements in job, queue, application, or default GPU
          requirement.

       *  The effective GPU requirement is the one used by a started
          job. It never changes after a job is started.

       Jobs that are submitted with an esub (or epsub) by using bsub -a
       (or modified by using bmod -a), shows the latest esubs used for
       execution in bjobs -l output, first with the default and then
       user esubs. If a user-specified esub script is the same as the
       default esub script, the duplicate esubs shows as one entry. If a
       job is submitted with an esub containing parameters, the esub and
       its parameters are shown in bjobs -l as well, and the format of
       the esub is the same as the esub that is specified in the job
       submission. For example:

       bsub -a "test(a,b,c) " sleep 10000

       is shown as:

       Job <1561>, User <joes>, Project <default>, Status <RUN>, Queue
       <normal>,
       Command <sleep 1000000>, Share group charged </joes>, Esub
       <test(a,b,c)>

       If enhanced energy accounting with IBM Spectrum LSF Explorer is
       enabled (with LLSSFF__EENNAABBLLEE__BBEEAATT__SSEERRVVIICCEE in lsf.conf), output shows
       the energy usage in Joule and kWh.

       If the lsb.params configuration file is configured with ALLOCA‐
       TION_PLANNER = Y, and sets of candidate jobs have been identified
       for consideration for an allocation plan, LSF creates a schedul‐
       ing and reservation allocation plan.

       *  bjobs –l : displays the planned start time for all jobs with
          an allocation plan.

       *  bjobs –l –plan : filter for jobs with allocation plans,
          displaying the planned start time and planned allocation for
          each job.

          *  For the JOB_NAME field, bjobs removes the header characters
             and replaces them with an asterisk (*)

          *  For other fields, bjobs truncates the ending characters

       *  Specify a hyphen (-) to set right justification when
          bjobs displays the output for the specific field. If not
          specified, the default is to set left justification when bjobs
          displays the output for a field.

       *  Specify a second colon (:) with a unit to specify a unit
          prefix for the output for the following fields: mem,

          swaplimit, corelimit, stacklimit, and
          hrusage (for hrusage, the unit prefix is for
          mem and swap resources only).

          This unit is KB (or K) for kilobytes, MB (or
          M) for megabytes, GB (or G) for gigabytes,
          TB (or T) for terabytes, PB (or P) for
          petabytes, EB (or E) for exabytes, ZB (or
          Z) for zettabytes), or S to automatically adjust
          the value to a suitable unit prefix and remove the "bytes"
          suffix from the unit. The default is to automatically adjust
          the value to a suitable unit prefix, but keep the "bytes"
          suffix in the unit.

          The display value keeps two decimals but rounds up the third
          decimal. For example, if the unit prefix is set to G,
          10M displays as 0.01G.

          The unit prefix specified here overrides the value of the

          LLSSBB__UUNNIITT__FFOORR__JJOOBBSS__DDIISSPPLLAAYY parameter in the lsf.conf
          file.

       *  Use delimiter= to set the delimiting character to
          display between different headers and fields. This delimiter
          must be a single character. By default, the delimiter is a
          space.

       To specify special delimiter characters in a csh environment (for
       example, $), use double quotation marks (") in the delimiter
       specification and single quotation marks (') in the -o statement:

       bjobs ... -o '_f_i_e_l_d___n_a_m_e[:[-][_o_u_t_p_u_t___w_i_d_t_h]]
        ... [delimiter="_c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r"]'

       The -o option applies only to output for certain bjobs options:

       *  This option applies to output for the bjobs command with no
          options, and for bjobs options with short form output that
          filter information, including the following options: -a, -app,
          -d, -g, -G, -J, -Jd, -Lp, -m, -P, -q, -r, -sla, -u, -x, -X.

       *  This option applies to output for bjobs options that use a
          modified format and filter information, including the
          following options: -fwd, -N, -p, -s.

       *  This option does not apply to output for bjobs options that
          use a modified format, including the following options: -A,
          -aff, -aps, -l, -UF, -ss, -sum, -UF, -w, -W, -WF, -WL, -WP.

       The bjobs -o option overrides the LLSSBB__BBJJOOBBSS__FFOORRMMAATT environment
       variable, which overrides the LLSSBB__BBJJOOBBSS__FFOORRMMAATT setting in
       lsf.conf.

       The following are the field names used to specify the bjobs
       fields to display, recommended width, aliases you can use instead
       of field names, and units of measurement for the displayed field:

       TTaabbllee 11.. OOuuttppuutt ffiieellddss ffoorr bbjjoobbss

       Field names and aliases are not case-sensitive. Valid values for
       the output width are any positive integer 1 - 4096. If the jobid
       field is defined with no output width and LLSSBB__JJOOBBIIDD__DDIISSPP__LLEENNGGTTHH
       is defined in lsf.conf, the LLSSBB__JJOOBBIIDD__DDIISSPP__LLEENNGGTTHH value is used
       for the output width.  If jobid is defined with a specified out‐
       put width, the specified output width overrides the
       LLSSBB__JJOOBBIIDD__DDIISSPP__LLEENNGGTTHH value.

       This command (used to illustrate the different subcommands for
       -o) displays the following fields for a job with the job ID 123:

       *  JOBID with unlimited width and left-aligned. If
          LSB_JOBID_DISP_LENGTH is specified, that value is used for the
          output width instead.

       *  STAT with a maximum width of 5 characters (which is the
          recommended width) and left-aligned.

       *  QUEUE with a maximum width of 10 characters (which is the
          recommended width) and right-aligned.

       *  PROJECT with a maximum width of 10 characters and
          left-aligned.

       *  APPLICATION with a maximum width of 6 characters and
          right-aligned.

       *  MEM with a maximum width of 12 characters, a unit prefix of G
          (for gigabytes), and left-aligned.

       *  The ^ character is displayed between different headers
          and fields.

       Displays the pending reason or reasons and the number of hosts
       giving that reason.

       *  0: Displays bjobs -p output as before the LSF 10.1 release.

       *  1: Displays the single key pending reason.

       *  2: Displays categorized host-based pending reasons for
          candidate hosts in the cluster. For the candidate hosts, the
          actual reason on each host is shown. For each pending reason,
          the number of hosts that give the reason is shown. The actual
          pending reason messages appear from most to least common.

       *  3: Displays categorized host-based pending reasons for both
          candidate and non-candidate hosts in the cluster. For both the
          candidate and non-candidate hosts, the actual pending reason
          on each host is shown. For each pending reason, the number of
          hosts that show that reason is given. The actual reason
          messages appear from most to least common.

       If no level is specified, the default is shown, as set by the
       LSB_BJOBS_PENDREASON_LEVEL parameter in the lsf.conf file.

       If global limits are enabled (that is, the GGLLOOBBAALL__LLIIMMIITTSS parame‐
       ter is enabled in the lsb.params file and global limits are
       defined in the lsb.globalpolicies file), the pending reason also
       includes the total global limit amount for the resource alloca‐
       tion limit in the Global field if the job is blocked by the
       global limit value and the existing Limit Value field is a dynam‐
       ically changing number that is taken from the global limits. In
       addition, the format of the job group name changes to
       "/_j_o_b___g_r_o_u_p/@_c_l_u_s_t_e_r" to show the cluster name.

       With IBM Spectrum LSF License Scheduler (LSF License Scheduler),
       the pending reason also includes the project name for project
       mode and the cluster name for cluster mode features. Jobs with an
       invalid project name show the project name as a hyphen (-).  If a
       default project is configured for that feature, it shows default
       as the project name.

       If -l is also specified, the pending reason shows the names of
       the hosts and any hosts that are on the job's host exclusion
       list.

       With the LSF multicluster capability, -l shows the names of hosts
       in the local cluster.

       Each pending reason is associated with one or more hosts and it
       states the cause why these hosts are not allocated to run the

       job that is eligible for scheduling and will be run if there are

       An ineligible pending job remains pending even if there are
       enough resources to run it and is therefore ineligible for sched‐
       uling. Reasons for a job to remain pending, and therefore be in
       an ineligible pending state, include the following:

       *  The job has a start time constraint (specified with the -b
          option)

       *  The job is suspended while pending (in a PSUSP state).

       *  The queue of the job is made inactive by the administrator or
          by its time window.

       *  The job's dependency conditions are not satisfied.

       *  The job cannot fit into the run time window (RRUUNN__WWIINNDDOOWW)

       *  Delayed scheduling is enabled for the job
          (NNEEWW__JJOOBB__SSCCHHEEDD__DDEELLAAYY is greater than zero)

       *  The job's queue or application profile does not exist.

       A job that is not under any of the ineligible pending state con‐
       ditions is treated as an eligible pending job. In addition, for
       chunk jobs in WAIT status, the time spent in the WAIT status is
       counted as eligible pending time.
